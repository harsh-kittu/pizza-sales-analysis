# üçï Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Pizza Sales Data Analysis** project! This repository showcases how SQL is used to analyze pizza sales data and extract meaningful insights to improve business performance. The project calculates **key performance indicators (KPIs)**, explores daily and hourly sales trends, and evaluates the best and worst-selling pizzas.

### üìä Project Dashboard
To visually complement the analysis, here‚Äôs the **Excel Dashboard** summarizing key insights from the data:

## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

In this section, we calculate the **core metrics** essential for understanding overall pizza sales performance.

### 1. What is the total revenue from pizza sales?
```sql
# Total Revenue:
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue 
FROM pizza_sales;
```
- **Total Revenue** gives a direct snapshot of all revenue generated by pizza sales.

### 2. What is the average order value?
```sql
# Average Order Value:
SELECT (SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) AS Avg_order_Value 
FROM pizza_sales;
```
- **Average Order Value** helps assess the typical revenue generated per order.

### 3. How many pizzas were sold in total?
```sql
# Total Pizzas Sold:
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_pizza_sold 
FROM pizza_sales;
```
- This query sums up the **total number of pizzas** sold.

### 4. How many orders were placed?
```sql
# Total Orders:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders 
FROM pizza_sales;
```
- Provides a count of the **total unique orders** placed.

### 5. What is the average number of pizzas sold per order?
```sql
# Average Pizzas Per Order:
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 
CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) 
AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order 
FROM pizza_sales;
```
- Useful for understanding the **average number of pizzas** included in each order.

## üìÖ Trend Analysis

Analyzing the trends in **sales by day** and **hour** gives valuable insights into customer behavior and peak ordering times.

### 6. What is the daily trend of total orders?
```sql
# Daily Trend for Total Orders:
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);
```
- This query breaks down the **number of orders by day of the week**, helping understand which days are the busiest.

### 7. What is the hourly trend of orders throughout the day?
```sql
# Hourly Trend for Orders:
SELECT DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) as order_hours, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as total_orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)
ORDER BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time);
```
- Provides insights into the **busiest times of day** for orders.

## üçï Category and Size Analysis

These queries help understand the **performance of different pizza categories and sizes** in terms of revenue contribution.

### 8. What percentage of total sales does each pizza category contribute?
```sql
# % of Sales by Pizza Category:
SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category;
```
- Helps determine the **revenue share** of each pizza category.

### 9. What percentage of total sales does each pizza size contribute?
```sql
# % of Sales by Pizza Size:
SELECT pizza_size, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_size
ORDER BY pizza_size;
```
- Helps evaluate the **sales performance** of different pizza sizes.

## üèÜ Best and Worst Sellers

Understanding which pizzas are the **most and least popular** helps businesses manage inventory and optimize the menu.

### 10. How many pizzas were sold by category in February?
```sql
# Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category (February):
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(quantity) as Total_Quantity_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 2
GROUP BY pizza_category
ORDER BY Total_Quantity_Sold DESC;
```
- Focuses on the total sales for each category during **February**.

### 11. What are the top 5 best-selling pizzas?
```sql
# Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold DESC;
```
- Lists the **top 5 pizzas** with the highest sales volumes.

### 12. What are the bottom 5 best-selling pizzas?
```sql
# Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold ASC;
```
- Highlights the **least popular pizzas**, offering insights into potential menu adjustments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **SQL**:  
   - Used for querying the pizza sales database to extract insights such as total revenue, average order value, sales trends, and best/worst-selling pizzas.
  
- **Excel**:  
   - **Data Cleaning**:  
      - Removed duplicates and handled missing values to ensure the dataset was accurate and complete.
   - **Data Aggregation**:  
      - Applied **pivot tables** to summarize key metrics such as total sales by pizza category, revenue by pizza size, and monthly sales trends.
   - **Dashboard Creation**:  
      - Built an interactive **Excel Dashboard** using charts (bar, line, and pie charts) to visualize KPIs and sales trends.  
      - Dynamic slicers were implemented to allow filtering of data based on pizza size, category, and time period.  
      - The dashboard provides a visual representation of insights, making it easy to share with stakeholders.
